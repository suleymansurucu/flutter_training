Collections
- Array
- List
- Map, Set, Stack, Queue

> Dart provides powerful collection types such as List, Map, Set, Stack, Queue.

 - List:
    A List in Dart is an ordered collection of elements. It behaves similarly to arrays in other languages.
     * Fixed-Length list: A list with a predefined size.
     * A list that can dynamically grow or shrink
 - Map:
    A map is collection of key-value pairs. Key must be unique. Fast Access to data via keys.

- Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Removing duplicates or maintaining unique values.

- Stack:
    Dart does not have a built-in Stack class, but you can use a List to implement stack functionality. Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

- Queue:
    Dart provides the Queue class under the dart:collection library. It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) priciple. Processing element in a sequential manner.
