- var v1 = "Hello";
- final v2 = "Hello";
- const v3 = "Hello";
- static const v4 = "Hello";
- static final v5 = "Hello";

- Summary:
> Variables :
  - String: is used to store text data.
  - int: is used to store integer(whole number) values.
  - double: is used to store decimal (floating-point) numbers
  - bool: is used to store boolean values: true or false
  - DateTime: is used to store date and time values.

  - Dynamic Types: If the of the variable is not known beforehand, you can use dynamic. However, it is not recommended for strong type safety.

  - Key Points About Variables:
   - var: The type is inferred automatically based on the assigned value.
   -final and const : use these for immutable variables.
    -final: value is determined at runtime.
    -const: Value is determined at compile-time

> Mutable and Immutable
  - Mutable: Variables whose values can be modified.
    Examples: var, dynamic, or mutable collections like lists.
  - Immatable: Variables whose values cannot be modified after declaration.
    Examples: Variables declared with final and const.
